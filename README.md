Detailed Case study : https://www.bansarishah.com/easyvacay

Scripts:

Easy-Vacay/Assets/Namescript.cs - It is used to fetch the name of the selected destination when user clicks on "Add" button in its 360 degree video. 

Easy-Vacay/Assets/AddName.cs - It is used to add names of the destinations which are presented in 360 degree videos in Easy Vacay in Hashset called as "listnames" in order to save unique names.

Easy-Vacay/Assets/Scripts/LoadScene.cs - This script is edited to retain the value of different destinations in a hashset even if the scenes changes and display them together in the last scene with their respective descriptions. It also shows the count of the selected destinations. 

Easy-Vacay/Assets/Scripts/SendEmail.cs - It is used to send the list of the selected destinations to the user's registered email Id so that it can be useful while planning the trips. (Developed by my project partner Shreya Patil)
